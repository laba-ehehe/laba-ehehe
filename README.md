<h1>Hi there — I’m Lan Anh! 👋</h1>

<img align="right" src="assets/pixel-lan-anh.png" width="175" alt="Lan Anh pixel avatar" />

I’m a UF Computer Engineering + Economics student who bridges **PM ↔ SWE**: I turn fuzzy problems into clear **PRDs/MVPs**, then build the backend/front-end/ML pieces, instrument metrics, and iterate with quick experiments.

## 🌸 Top projects
- **ChompCourse**: TypeScript/JS + Flask/React + Firebase/Expo | **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/katieboetig/ChompCourse)**  
  - Full-stack degree planner with catalog scraping + prereq graphs. I scoped the MVP, helped define data models/flows, and shipped a student-tested pilot.

- **SET Dumpy**: Python/OpenCV + Arduino + LiDAR/SLAM | **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AlanWang611/SET2023)**  
  - Mobile robot for debris detection/pickup. I worked on CV pipeline integration, sensor/actuation bring-up, and acceptance tests for reliable field performance.

- **Copycat**: JavaScript (MV3) | **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/laba-ehehe/copycat)**  
  - Chrome extension that captures job posts, notes, and deadlines. I wrote the PRD, built the MV3 service worker + storage, and designed a minimal UI to speed workflows.

- **Erica Virtual Human**: Python/Flask + FFmpeg | **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/laba-ehehe/Erica-Virtual-Human)**  
  - Conversational tutoring with lip-synced video. I designed the interaction flow, implemented the API + lip-sync pipeline, and ran quick UX tests with students.

## 🧠 ML projects
- **Supermarket Sales Analytics**: scikit-learn + pandas | **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/laba-ehehe/supermarket-sales-analytics)**  
  - End-to-end pipeline: EDA → feature engineering → grid-searched baselines; clear metrics and README.

- **Satellite Ship Detection**: PCA/Isomap + RF/SVM | **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/laba-ehehe/ship-detection)**  
  - Dimensionality reduction for compact features, classic models for robust accuracy; evaluated with held-out tests.

- **Image Classification**: PyTorch | **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/laba-ehehe/ann-flower-classification-car-detection)**  
  - Flower & car datasets; ANN/CNN baseline improved via augmentation/regularization; tracked lift and confusion matrices.

## 💼 Internship experience
- **SWE/Data Science Intern — AltaScient** *(Python · PyTorch · SQL · FastAPI · Docker)*  
  - Prototyped a risk-analytics NN and exposed inference via FastAPI; built data/feature pipelines and experiment logs, and defined success metrics for iterations.

- **PM Intern — MoMo (M_Service)** *(Bazel · Jenkins · SQL · Jira)*  
  - Wrote PRDs and prioritized lending-platform features using data insights; streamlined CI/CD with Bazel + Jenkins and tracked delivery/impact with sprint metrics.

- **PM Intern — Nami Technology** *(Flask · scikit-learn · NoSQL · Figma)*  
  - Shipped an NLP conversation-analysis tool and dashboard; led usability tests, synthesized feedback, and iterated UI/UX with measurable improvements.

- **Research Intern — Fudan ISTBI** *(Python · LFP)*  
  - Processed neural signals and explored Parkinson’s biomarkers; produced analysis notebooks and concise summaries for the research team.
